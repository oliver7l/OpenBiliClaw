/**
 * Toolbar action badge state — pure decision table, kept out of the service
 * worker so it is unit-testable.
 *
 * Two independent signals feed one badge:
 *  - `reachable`: backend HTTP/WS reachability (`null` = not probed yet)
 *  - `uninitialized`: backend reachable but reporting `initialized === false`
 *    (guided init never completed)
 *
 * Unreachable wins over uninitialized: a down backend's init state is
 * unknown, and "start the daemon" is the actionable hint there. A reachable
 * but uninitialized backend must NOT render the same empty badge as a healthy
 * one — that silence is exactly what kept fresh installs from ever noticing
 * the guided-init entry.
